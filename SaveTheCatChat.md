Below is a novel-focused reinterpretation of the Save the Cat! genres — specifically tuned for novels, especially sci-fi, fantasy, and general fiction.

Movies must be lean; novels can braid multiple plot engines (quest + mystery + romance + internal arc).
So each genre below is reframed to reflect how novels naturally combine plot + world + character transformation.

Got it — here is a cleaner, more user-friendly quiz with 5 answer options per question, each mapping to 2 genres.
This keeps the quiz short, readable, and still highly accurate.

We’ll map the 10 genres into 5 answer categories:

Answer Option	Maps to Genres
A. External Threat / Crisis	Encroaching Doom (1) + Thrust-Into-Chaos Survivor (4)
B. Journey / Discovery	Transformative Quest (2) + Buried Truth (7)
C. Power / Destiny	Power With a Price (3) + Burdened Prodigy (10)
D. Internal / Emotional Arc	Inner Metamorphosis (5) + Emergent Hero (8)
E. Relationship / System Conflict	Converging Destinies (6) + Defying the Order (9)
This simplified mapping lets your quiz score both the primary genre and the closest supporting genre accurately.

Want this in a JSON schema or TypeScript model for your app’s quiz engine?
You said:
What’s missing from this quiz?
ChatGPT said:
Here’s what’s missing — and what you may want to add — for the quiz to become a complete diagnostic tool for a novel-planning app.

Below is a refined analysis of what’s not yet captured:

1. Subplot Identification
The quiz determines the main genre, but not the subplot genre, which is crucial because most novels run:

Plot A: external (quest, prophecy, threat)

Plot B: relationship or emotional arc

Plot C: mystery or system conflict

You may want questions that detect:

Romance subplot

Rivalry subplot

Mystery subplot

Political intrigue subplot

Emotional healing subplot

Mentor/student subplot

These help shape the Snowflake Method output.

2. Tone & Style Questions
The quiz touches on emotional DNA, but not:

Pacing (slow burn vs. action-heavy)

Tone (dark, whimsical, gritty, hopeful, comedic, tragic)

Audience (YA vs. adult)

Narrative voice (intimate, epic, ensemble, multi-POV)

These drastically shift genre interpretation.

Example missing questions:
“Does your story lean dark, hopeful, or humorous?”
“Single POV or multi-POV?”
“Action-driven or contemplative?”

3. Stakes Level Granularity
We ask “What are the stakes about?” but not:

How personal vs. how global

Are the stakes emotional, physical, ideological?

Does the protagonist fail publicly or privately?

Genre hybridization depends heavily on scale.

4. Plot Shape / Structure Archetypes
We don’t yet help the author identify classic structure shapes:

Hero’s Journey

Three-Act vs. Four-Act

Dual timeline

Spiral/episodic

Heist structure

War campaign structure

Mystery investigation loop

Political ladder structure

These matter for generating outputs.

5. Antagonist Type
We don’t ask questions that reveal:

Monster

System

Rival

Shadow self

Mentor turned villain

Cosmic force

Relationship conflict

These connect strongly to genre scoring.

6. Theme Drivers
We cover some broad themes, but not:

Fate vs. free will

Power vs. corruption

Love vs. fear

Knowledge vs. ignorance

Tradition vs. progress

Identity vs. belonging

Genre + theme pairings can sharpen the output.

7. Setting Category
Missing questions that nail:

Secondary fantasy world

Sci-fi futuristic tech

Near-future techpunk

Urban fantasy

Historical fantasy

Contemporary earth with magic

Low-magic vs. high-magic worlds

These settings shift the interpretation of genre.

8. Character Ensemble Size
Some genres work best with:

Solo protagonist (Prodigy, Metamorphosis)

Duo dynamic (Converging Destinies)

Team ensemble (Quest, Order-fight)

We don’t ask about ensemble vs. lone wolf.

9. “Promise of the Premise” Flavor
Missing categories like:

Battles vs. puzzles

Romance vs. bromance

Horror vs. adventure

Political maneuvering vs. dungeon crawling

Hard sci-fi vs. soft sci-fi

Cozy fantasy vs. grimdark

These refine genre output.

10. Ending Type
We do ask about endings, but not whether it’s:

Tragic

Bittersweet

Triumphant

Open-ended

Cyclical

Twist-ending

Ending tone influences genre interpretation.

SUMMARY — Gaps in the Quiz
The quiz is missing questions that capture:

Subplots

Tone & style

Stakes scale

Structure type

Antagonist type

Thematic drivers

Setting category

Ensemble size

“Flavor” expectations

Ending tone depth

If you want…

Ready for integration into your Snowflake+STC novel app

Would you like a full expanded 40–50 question version? Or a modular format where the user only answers sections relevant to their story?

You said:
Modular sounds interesting 
ChatGPT said:
Great — modular is the most author-friendly and the most adaptable approach for your app.
Below is a clear modular architecture that breaks the quiz into self-contained units. Authors can complete only the modules they want, and your app can dynamically generate genre + structure + theme + subplot outputs based on completed modules.

This becomes a full diagnostic tool for novel planning.

📦 MODULAR NOVEL-PLANNING QUIZ SYSTEM
A flexible questionnaire system to identify Genre + Structure + Subplots + Themes + World + Tone
🧩 Module Overview
The quiz should be divided into 8 modules, each with 5–10 multiple-choice questions.

Each module stands alone.

Treat all other modules as optional enhancers

Weight modules differently (Genre > Subplot > Tone)

Life vs. death

These theme tags influence:

Suggested symbols

Character transformations

🧮 HOW THE MODULAR SYSTEM WORKS
Weighting:
Module 1 (Required) = 60% of total genre score

Modules 2–8 (Optional) = 40% combined weighting

Each optional module modifies outcomes, not replaces them

Example:
If someone gets:

High score in "Journey" from Module 1

High score in "Heist" from Module 2

High score in "Found Family" in Module 3

High score in "Soft Sci-Fi" in Module 4

Your app would classify their story as:

Heist Quest with Found-Family Dynamics in a Soft Sci-Fi World
Subplots: Mystery & Rivalry
Themes: Identity and Belonging

And would provide beat templates accordingly.

🎉 All 8 modules are now complete.
If you'd like:

✔ Combine all modules into a single JSON file
✔ Generate TypeScript interfaces
✔ Add scoring logic for genres + structure + subplots
✔ Design the UI flow for your app
✔ Auto-generate Snowflake + Save-the-Cat templates based on quiz output
Which would you like next?

You said:
Add the scoring logic.

Thought for 24s
Nice, this is the fun part. Let’s wire this thing up so your app can actually score all the quiz answers and spit out genres/structures/tags.

I’ll do three things:

Define a general scoring model (how all modules work).

Show full scoring JSON for Module 1 (already close, just add how to process).

Add scoring maps for Modules 2–8, so each answer contributes to one or more tags.

You can then plug this into TypeScript/JS easily.

1. General Scoring Model
Core idea
Each module has:

questions (with answers)

a scoring block that says:

what kind of tags it produces (e.g. "genres", "structures", "subplots", "tone", etc.)

how answers map to those tags

When a user chooses an answer:

Look up the tags connected to that answer

Add +1 to each tag’s score

At the end of the module:

Sort tags by score

Take the top N as that module’s result

Generic structure for scoring
interface QuizModule {
  module: string;
  description: string;
  scoring: {
    type: string; // e.g. "genres", "structures", "subplots", etc.
    mapping: {
      // Different per-module: could be answer-key → tags OR per-question.
    };
  };
  questions: Question[];
}

interface Question {
  id: number;
  question: string;
  answers: Record<string, string>; // "A" -> "answer text"
}
2. Module 1 — Scoring Logic (Genres)
Here’s Module 1 with explicit scoring (you already have most of this):

{
  "module": "Core Story Engine",
  "description": "20-question diagnostic quiz to determine the story's primary engine and genre.",
  "scoring": {
    "type": "genres",
    "mapping": {
      "A": ["Encroaching Doom", "Thrust-Into-Chaos Survivor"],
      "B": ["Transformative Quest", "Buried Truth"],
      "C": ["Power With a Price", "Burdened Prodigy"],
      "D": ["Inner Metamorphosis", "Emergent Hero"],
      "E": ["Converging Destinies", "Defying the Order"]
    }
  },
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What primarily drives your story forward?",
      "answers": {
        "A": "A looming threat or sudden crisis",
        "B": "A journey across worlds or uncovering secrets",
        "C": "A powerful ability, artifact, or destiny",
        "D": "A deep emotional change or personal growth",
        "E": "A key relationship or conflict with a group/system"
      }
    }
    // ... questions 2–20 exactly as we already defined
  ]
}
Pseudocode to score Module 1
function scoreModule1(module, userAnswers: Record<number, string>) {
  const genreScores: Record<string, number> = {};
  const map = module.scoring.mapping; // A–E mapping to genre arrays

  for (const q of module.questions) {
    const answerKey = userAnswers[q.id]; // "A".."E"
    if (!answerKey) continue;

    const genres = map[answerKey] || [];
    for (const g of genres) {
      genreScores[g] = (genreScores[g] || 0) + 1;
    }
  }

  // sort by score
  const sorted = Object.entries(genreScores).sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);

  return {
    scores: genreScores,
    primaryGenre: sorted[0]?.[0] || null,
    secondaryGenre: sorted[1]?.[0] || null
  };
}
3. Scoring Logic for Modules 2–8
For simplicity, I’ll:

Give each module a scoring.type

Add a mapping for answer letters → tags

You score them exactly like Module 1, but tags differ

You can refine tag names later; they’re just strings.

MODULE 5 — Tone, Style & Audience

If you’d like, next I can:

Write a generic scoreModule() function that works for all modules (including special case for Module 5’s per-question mapping), in TypeScript.

Or bundle all modules into one big JSON file you can just drop into the project.
