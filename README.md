# Snowflake
Snowflake + STC novel planner
Novel Planning App

A modular, modern planning tool for outlining novels using the Snowflake Method + Save the Cat.

Overview

This project is a lightweight, modern web app designed to guide writers through the novel-planning process. It combines the structured Snowflake Method with the narrative shaping of Save the Cat beat guidelines. The app provides optional genre clarification tools, step-by-step planning wizards, and integrated tips based on user choices.

The goal:
A smooth, guided, flexible outlining experience that supports beginners and experienced writers alike.
